FINAL:
If you give a final keyword to any variable.you cannot change the final variable.


If you make any class final. We cannot extend it.
If you make any method final. We cannot override it.
  



Java bean:
It is an object. All the members are private. To access private members there must be getter & setter methods.


Can we create final abstract methods?
No, we cannot create a final abstract method because the final method cannot be overridden by a subclass but an abstract method can override by a subclass. 
If we give a both final and abstract keyword to the method it shows error at compile time.

Public:
If a class is declared as public then we can access that class from anywhere.
Private:
If a class is declared as private then we can access it only inside the class.
Protected:
The protected keyword in Java is an access modifier. It can be assigned to variables, methods, constructors and inner classes. The protected access modifier is accessible within the package. However, it can also be accessible outside the package but through Inheritance only.

DISPATCH:
THERE ARE TWO TYPES;
1. STATIC DISPATCH:
               The static dispatch is also called as early binding and when the method call is resolved at compile time.
2. DYNAMIC DISPATCH:
      The dynamic dispatch is also call as late binding and when the 
Method call is resolved at run time.
              Dynamic dispatch is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

Polymorphism:
Polymorphism is a concept in which we can perform a single action into a different form.
The other name of polymorphism is many forms.


Method overloading
In  a class there are multiple methods having the same names but different in parameters.
The formulae are the same but signature is different.
EXAMPLE
Class Adder{
Static int add(int a,int b){return a+b;}
Static int add(int a,int b){return a+b+c;}


Method overriding
If a subclass has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as overriding.
EXAMPLE
class Animal {
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
  }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
  @Override
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println("Dog barks");
  }
}
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Animal a1 = new Animal();
    a1.makeSound();
    Dog d1 = new Dog();
    d1.makeSound();
  }
}

Java do-while loop;
1. The java do-while loop condition is used to repeat the programming until the specified condition is true.
2. Java do-while loop is called an exit control loop.
  

If we want infinite values use the while(true) key.

One child interface can have multiple parent interfaces.
A class can extend another class and can implement one and more than one java interface.

Inheritance in java:
* Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
Types of inheritance in java:
There are 5 types of inheritance in java.
1. Single inheritance
In single inheritance,a subclass inherits the features of one super class.
2. Multilevel  inheritance
In multilevel inheritance, a subclass extends from a superclass and then the same subclass acts as a superclass for another class


  













3. Hierarchical  inheritance
In hierarchical inheritance, multiple subclasses extend from a single superclass
  



4. Multiple  inheritance
In multiple inheritance, a single subclass extends from multiple superclasses
  



5. Hybrid  inheritance
Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.

If else operators:  




JAVA logical operators
* &&(logical AND)  =  Both expressions are true this operator is used
* || (logical OR)     =   either expression 1 or either expression 2 is true this operator is used
* ! (logical NOT)   =  if expression is false this operator shows true.
  

Unary operators;
* ++ :  increments value by 1
* - -  :  decrements value by 1

      Find out all initialized values in primitive data types in java language?
  In java there are eight primitive data types
Int:0
short:0
     long: 0
     byte: 0
     byte: 0
     float: 0.0f
     double: 0.0d
     char: '\u0000
     
     Objective default values are null in java.
   * (myObject, new MyObject ());
   *  MyObject result = Objects.

Class structure 
class Classname { 
             //class members 
             1.Data members 
              2. Behavioral members
   }
Data members we have to specify data type before variable.
Data members are of 2 types: 
1.primitive Data Types: primitive data types store a single value. Primitive data types are int,float,char,double,long,short,boolean
2.Derived Data Types:Derived data types are derived from the primitive data types.
Derived Data types are arrays,objects,and strings.


Object: object is a real time entity.object name should be a real world specified name.
Syntax: class_definition_name obj_name;
Ex: car kiselosT;


Bank account type : Bank account type holds int.
Bank account transaction type: Deposit- float,withdraw-float.interest -float.

Topic: Public static void main(String args[])


   * Public=this syntax is an access modifier used for classes,constructors, making them accessible by any other class.
                    So JVM can execute from anywhere.
   *  static=the main method is without an object.
   *   void=this keyword specifies that a method should not provide a return value.
   *  main=the compiler executes code starting always from the main syntax.
   * String=the main method accepts a single argument.

Topics:
    JAVA:
   * Java is a programming language.
   * Java was developed by a “SUN MICROSYSTEM” in the year 1995.
   * James gosling is known as the father of java.
   * Before JAVA its name was “OAK”
   * “OAK” name is already registered as a company name so James changed the name from “OAK” to “JAVA”.
   * Platform of Java is JRE(Java runtime environment) and API (Application programming interface).


JAVA APPLICATIONS:
   * Desktop applications such as acrobat reader,media player,antivirus.
   * Web applications such as irctc.co.in
   * Banking applications.
   * Mobiles.
   * Smart cards.
   * RObotics.
   * Games..etc


JAVA APPLICATIONS ARE CLASSIFIED INTO 4 TYPES:
   *  Standalone applications.     
Standalone applications are desktop applications.These applications that we need to install in every machine or device.
EX;Media player.   
               AWT & SWING are used in java to create standard applications.                                                              
   * Web applications:
An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application.
Servlet,spring and hibernate are used to create a web application.


   * Enterprise application:
An application that is distributed in nature,such as banking applications.
It has high advantages like high level security,and clustering.
         EJB is used to create enterprise applications.


   * Mobile applications:
An application which is created for mobile devices is called a mobile application.
Android and java ME(micro edition) are used to create mobile applications.

1. WHAT ARE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF AN OPERATING SYSTEM.
·         The operating system (OS) is a software that manages the hardware and software resources of a computer system.
·         The operating system provides different operations in a system…
·         They are…
Device management
Memory management
Process management
File management
Security
                  Error detection
·         The operating system acts as a mediator between the computer user and a computer hardware.
And also it provides an application running in a system and detection of errors in a system.
2. Verify the different data types in java.
·         Java has two types of data.
Primitive type
Non-primitive type
 
   *  PRIMITIVE TYPE
         Primitive data type is the most basic data type in a java language.
        “  Int, short, long, float, Boolean, char ,byte,double”
   *  NON-PRIMITIVE TYPE
The non-primitive type data is not defined by a programming language but it is created by a programmer.
     “classes, interface, and arrays”.
